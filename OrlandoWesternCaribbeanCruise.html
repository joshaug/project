<h1>ORLANDO and WESTERN CARIBBEAN CRUISE AND STAY</h1>



<h3>Sailing onboard The Silver Sea</h3>
<p>A cruise aboard the The Silver Sea offers you a chance to let your hair down, kick
back and truly relax. Visit the Spa for some treatments ranging from the traditional 
to the exotic or bathe in both sun and water at the Pool. This cruise allows you to 
peruse original paintings by well-known artists in the onboard Art Gallery and purchase 
any that catch your eye. If you feel like keeping active then visit the fitness centre. 
Dining options are plentiful aboard the The Silver Sea with everything from steaks and 
seafood at the East Meets West Steakhouse to tapas from around the world at Pool Bar and 
Restaurant and lots more in between. And after a hard day of relaxation and fun enjoy a 
drink at the Panorama Lounge, where you can watch sky and sea change colours as the sun sets.</p>
