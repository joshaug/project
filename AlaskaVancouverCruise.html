<h1>ALASKA TO VANCOUVER CRUISE AND STAY</h1>




<h3>Sailing onboard The Silver Sea</h3>

<p>A cruise aboard the The Silver Sea offers you a chance to let your hair down, kick
back and truly relax. Visit the Spa for some treatments ranging from the traditional to the exotic or bathe in both sun and water at the Pool. 
This cruise allows you to peruse original paintings by well-known artists in the onboard Art Gallery and purchase any that catch your eye. 
If you feel like keeping active then visit the fitness centre. Dining options are plentiful aboard the The Silver Sea with everything from steaks 
and seafood at the East Meets West Steakhouse to tapas from around the world at Pool Bar and Restaurant and lots more in between. And after a hard 
day of relaxation and fun enjoy a drink at the Panorama Lounge, where you can watch sky and sea change colours as the sun sets.</p>

<h3>Day 1 - Seward (Anchorage), AK, United States of America</h3><img class ="headpic" src="images/Seward.jpg" alt="picture"/>
<p>It is hard to believe that a place as beautiful as Seward exists. Surrounded on all sides by Kenai Fjords National Park, 
Chugach National Forest, and Resurrection Bay, Seward offers all the quaint realities of a small railroad 
town with the bonus of jaw-dropping scenery. This little town of fewer than 3,000 citizens was founded in 1903, 
when survey crews arrived at the ice-free port and began planning a railroad to the Interior. Since its inception, 
Seward has relied heavily on tourism and commercial fishing. It is also the launching point for excursions into Kenai 
Fjords National Park, where it is quite common to see 
marine life and calving glaciers.</p>
<h3>Day 2 -  Cruise Hubbard Glacier, U.S.A., United States of America</h3><img class ="headpic" src="images/HubbardGlacier.jpg" alt="picture"  />

<h3>Day 3 - Sitka, Alaska, United States of America</h3><img class ="headpic" src="images/Sitka.jpg" alt="picture"  /> 
<p>It's hard not to like Sitka, with its eclectic blend of Alaska Native, Russian, and American history and its dramatic 
and beautiful open-ocean setting. This is one of the best Inside Passage towns to explore on foot, with such sights as 
St. Michael's Cathedral, Sheldon Jackson Museum, Castle Hill, Sitka National Historical Park, and the Alaska Raptor Center 
topping the town's must-see list. Sitka was home to the Kiksádi clan of the Tlingit people for centuries prior to the 
18th-century arrival of the Russians under the direction of territorial governor Alexander Baranof, who believed the region was ideal 
for the fur trade.</p> 
<h3>Day 4 - Juneau, Alaska, United States of America</h3>
<p>Juneau, Alaska's capital and third-largest city, is on the North American mainland 
but can't be reached by road. The city owes its origins to two colorful sourdoughs (Alaskan pioneers)-Joe Juneau and 
Richard Harris-and to a Tlingit chief named Kowee, who led the two men to rich reserves of gold at Snow Slide Gulch, t
he drainage of Gold Creek around which the town was eventually built. That was in 1880, and shortly thereafter a modest 
stampede resulted in the formation of a mining camp, which quickly grew to become the Alaska district government capital in 1906.</p>
<h3>Day 5 - Skagway, Alaska, United States of America</h3>
<p>Located at the northern terminus of the Inside Passage, Skagway is a one-hour ferry ride from Haines. By road, however, 
the distance is 359 miles, as you have to take the Haines Highway up to Haines Junction, Yukon, then take the Alaska Highway 100 miles 
south to Whitehorse, and then drive a final 100 miles south on the Klondike Highway to Skagway. North-country folk call this sightseeing 
route the Golden Horseshoe or Golden Circle tour, because it passes a lot of gold-rush country in addition to spectacular lake, forest, 
and mountain scenery. The town is an amazingly preserved artifact from North America's biggest, most-storied gold rush.</p>
<h3>Day 6 - Ketchikan, Alaska, United States of America</h3>
<p>Ketchikan is famous for its colorful totem poles, rainy skies, steep-as-San Francisco streets, and lush island 
setting. Some 13,500 people call the town home, and, in the summer, cruise ships crowd the shoreline, floatplanes 
depart noisily for Misty Fiords National Monument, and salmon-laden commercial fishing boats motor through Tongass 
Narrows. In the last decade Ketchikan's rowdy, blue-collar heritage of logging and fishing has been softened by the 
loss of many timber-industry jobs and the dramatic rise of cruise-ship tourism. With some effort, though, visitors can 
still glimpse the rugged frontier spirit that once permeated this hardscrabble cannery town.</p> 
<h3>Day 7 - Cruise Inside Passage, U.S.A, United States of America</h3>
<h3>Day 8 - Vancouver, Canada</h3><img class ="headpic" src="images/Vancouver-1.jpg" alt="picture"  />
<p>Consistently ranked as one of the world's most livable cities, Vancouver lures visitors with its abundance of natural beauty, 
multicultural vitality, and cosmopolitan flair. The attraction is as much in the range of food choices-the fresh seafood and local 
produce are some of North America's best-as it is in the museums, shopping opportunities, and beaches, parks, and gardens. Indeed, 
the Vancouver package is a delicious juxtaposition of urban sophistication and on-your-doorstep wilderness adventure.</p>
