<h1>NEW YORK and EASTERN CARIBBEAN CRUISE AND STAY</h1>




<h3>Sailing onboard 'Oasis of The Seas'</h3>

<p>The Oasis of the Seas is one of Royal Cruises most luxurious and well appointed ships. With seven distinct and vibrant neighbourhoods, including 
the stunning Central Park with its abundance of plant life and greenery, this Ship offers a level of variety and choice that is hard to find anywhere else. 
This cruise holiday offers you so many options between leisurely, relaxing pursuits and high-energy activities that it may be difficult to know where to start. 
You can stroll the onboard Boardwalk and check out the colourful hand-crafted carousel or head for a relaxing treatment at the Spa, take in a high-flying show at 
the Show Lounge, relax with a book in the Library and a look at the stunning views in the adults-only Le Champagne or grab a cold drink at the Bar. Aboard this 
ship you really are spoiled for choice when it comes time to dining. The Bar, The Restaurant, La Terrazza and the Pool Bar are just some of the many great 
restaurants you can choose from.</p>
